# photo-caption-contest
This is a portfolio project for the 'Security, Infrastructure, &amp; Scalability' section of Codecademy's Backend Engineer Career Path.

## Project brief
In this project you will create the backend for a platform for users to participate in a photo caption contest. Your server will host a few images and you will create endpoints to authenticate and authorize users. In order for a user to create a caption, they will need to be authenticated (signed in). You will need a database design and schema in order to integrate a database layer to store all your users and captions. You will use PostgreSQL and the ORM, sequelize to communicate between your database and your server. As you create your endpoints you will be testing them on Postman to ensure that they work correctly. Once the server is running, you will use a localized cache to optimize the performance of frequently requested data. Finally, you will write the documentation using Swagger and deploy your project to Render.

## Project Objectives
- Use Git version control
- Create documentation using the Swagger API
- Implement a database
- Integrate existing API endpoints with the database layer
- Database implementation for transactions
- Deploy the application using Render

## Prerequisites
- Command line and file navigation
- Git and GitHub
- Javascript
- Node.js/Express
- Postman
- PostgreSQL
- Database relationships and configuration
- Sequelize
- Render

## Setup 
To get started simply run the `npm install` command after cloning/forking the repo. 
before you start running the application with `npm test` be sure to have read and 
followed the instructions for setting up the database [./database/README.md](./database/README.md)
